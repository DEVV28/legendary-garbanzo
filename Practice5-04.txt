After watching the **Sessions Tutorials** answer the following:

:question:What function do we use to start a session?
 When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, and then you close it. This is much like a Session. 
The computer knows who you are. It knows when you start the application and when you end.
But on the internet there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.
:question:Where are these session variables stored? 
 all session variable values are stored in the global $_SESSION variable
